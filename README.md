# John Park . Jarvis Consulting

I studied computer science at the University of Toronto St. George. During my studies at the University of Toronto, I was first introduced to computer science's foundational and theoretical aspects such as time complexity, data structures, and algorithmic analysis. Afterwards, I was exposed to the applicable side of computer science by taking Web and Software development courses. Since then, I endeavoured to further develop the knowledge and the skills I gained from these courses by building Web and Mobile applications on my side time. Even now, I strive to build a web or mobile application in my free time to consistently absorb more knowledge and hone my skills in related fields because I aspire to be a competent software developer. Furthermore, I have more in-depth knowledge than mere software development because the computer science curriculum at the University of Toronto lead me to take more specialized courses such as Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Networks.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnPark/](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnPark/)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnPark//tree/master/linux_sql)]: Monitoring software for Jarvis Cluster Administration Team which automatically retrieves hardware specifications and resource usage from each machine and node of a Linux cluster. This program also initiates the database automatically and all the information retrieved from each node is stored there. The database is established using docker and PostgresSQL and the program is implemented using bash scripts. Furthermore, because the resource usages are dynamic over time from each machine or node, crontab was utilized to continually update the corresponding information on the database.


## Highlighted Projects
**Sentimental-Analysis-Of-Stocks (Swift)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/JohnPHK/Sentimental-Analysis-Of-Stocks.git)]: Built an iOS application containing a trained NLP model that predicts whether the stock market will increase or decrease based on twitter input. The NLP model is composed of Convolutional Neural Network and trained through extensive data from Twitter and news. The NLP model was able to run with the mobile application through TensorFlow Lite. Once the input is fed, the application will output an indication of whether the stock market is in an upwards trend or downwards trend with a confidence interval value.

**TextYourTile (MERN stack)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/JohnPHK/TextYourTile.git)]: Developed a MERN full-stack application deployed on Heroku. Thus, ReactJS was used for the frontend, Node/ExpressJS was used for the backend, and MongoDB was used for the database. It is an application where users can write on tiles laid out on the canvas. The tiles extend almost infinitely because as the user navigates around the tiles, the app generates new tiles. Anything that is written on the tiles are not deleted but stored in the database. The user can come back to see what they have written unless other users have erased or made a modification to it. Also, users can see others writing on tiles in real-time as the app utilizes a socket. This application has Login and Sign up feature. Users can personalize the profile and make a separate personalized canvas.

**Online-Educational-Performance-Analysis (Python)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/JohnPHK/Online-Education-Performance-Analysis.git)]: Developed machine learning models that predicts whether a student can answer diagnostic questions based on the student’s answer to previous answers to other questions. This will help online learning platforms to predict the students’ level of abilities and personalize the education service. For example, assigning the questions with proper difficulty levels. Using the data obtained from Kaggle, three different models using four ML different algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbourhood, Item Response Theory, Matrix Factorization - were developed. The accuracy of Item Response Theory (IRT) was improved by using the ensemble technique and by extending the one-parameter base IRT model to a two-parameter IRT model.

**File-System (C)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/JohnPHK/File-System.git)]: Designed and developed a Unix-based file system using C. This program behaves very similarly to the Linux file system. However, the data structure and the format of how data are stored behind have been customized. It is consisting of a superblock, inode bitmap block, 8 contiguous data-block bitmap blocks, 4 contiguous inode table blocks and finally the contiguous data blocks. Each block has a size of 4Kilo Bytes = 4096 Bytes. Just like the Linux file system, general information of the filesystem like the number of inodes, the number of data blocks, where the inode begins etc... are stored in the superblock. Likewise, the metadata of files and directories are stored in their inode. One can run this program by executing mkfs.a1fs file on an arbitrary directory. Then, it acts like there is a whole new file system on that directory. One can then perform commands like mkdir, touch, cd, ls etc…

**AlphabetTilesNSeaInvaders (Java)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/JohnPHK/AlphabetTilesNSeaInvaders.git)]: Built a mobile Android gaming application using Android Studio. This has a gaming centre which harbours three games – Sliding Tiles, Alphabet Tiles, and Sea Invaders. The goal of the sliding tiles is to align the tiles in order. This can be done by simply touching the tiles next to the empty tile. Alphabet Tiles start with A and when you combine two As you get Bs, and combining two Bs get you Cs and so on… The game demands you to get the alphabet Z. The Sea Invaders game has invaders invading from the top of the screen and moving down. The goal is to not let a single invader reach the bottom of the board. All these games have a scoring system through time. The shorter you finish the game, the better score you get. The game centre will keep track of these records and post the best-scored user. Thus, it is a competitive gaming app.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (Apr 2022-present)**: Developed applications and automated software for Jarvis projects and team. Used Linux/Bash, Git/Github, Docker/Dockerhub, Java, PostgreSQL and Virtual Machine by Google Cloud Platform for various software development projects. Collaborated and worked with other Jarvis consultants, the scrum master, and senior developers in the Agile/Scrum environment. Participated in daily scrum meetings and biweekly scrum sprint meetings. Communicated consistently with senior developers and the scrum master for technical and behavioural improvements.

**Laboratory Assistant, Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto (May 2016 - Sept 2016)**: Collaborated with researchers in the lab and helped them with research projects. Prepared materials and maintained the bio-model crucial to the projects in the lab. Washed agar plates and moved agar vials to the benches in demand. Constructed the agars which are used for lab activities and food for the bio-model.
